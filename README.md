## TraceUtility

Extract data from .trace documents generated by Instruments, using the undocumented frameworks shipped with Instruments.

In `Axe` , we use `TraceUtility` to get data from `.trace` documents to add Instruments Check Feature for our automation tests.

## modifed

* Log to stdout for bash usage
* The log file type is csv now, we can make graphics with .cvs file easily.
